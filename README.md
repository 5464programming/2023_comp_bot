# 2023_comp_bot

This is the codebase for FRC 5464 Bluejacket Robotics' competition robot for the 2023 season, Charged Up!

It is based on the TimedRobot Java template in WPIlib. 
The main process used was putting code into one long routine in TimedRobot, then splitting that out into separate classes.
Code was written by Eva and Gabe this season.
